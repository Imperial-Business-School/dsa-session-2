This is a GitHub Codespace for getting started with Python.
After the Codespace has started, look to the *Terminal* at the bottom of this window and type:

```
python
```

Press `Enter` and you should see some information on the version of Python, plus a new *prompt* that looks like this:

You can leave this Python prompt by typing;

```
quit()
```
